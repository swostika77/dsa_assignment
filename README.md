#  Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Assignment

##  Overview
This repository contains implementations of fundamental **Data Structures and Algorithms** concepts in C.  
Each program demonstrates core DSA concepts along with algorithm steps, execution results, and complexity analysis.

##  Programs Included

### 🔹 Program 1: Balanced Parentheses using Stack
Implements stack to check whether an expression has balanced parentheses.

### 🔹 Program 2: Infix to Postfix Conversion & Evaluation
Converts infix expression to postfix and evaluates the result using stack.

### 🔹 Program 3: Reverse Traversal of Linked List
Implements reverse traversal of a singly linked list.

### 🔹 Program 4: Doubly Linked List
Implements:
- Insertion after a given node  
- Deletion of a node  
- Display of list  

### 🔹 Program 5: Graph Traversal (BFS & DFS)
Implements undirected graph using adjacency matrix and performs:
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Depth First Search (DFS)

### 🔹 Program 6: Min Heap and Max Heap
Builds:
- Min Heap  
- Max Heap  
From an unsorted array.

### 🔹 Program 7: Dijkstra’s Algorithm
Implements Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm using adjacency matrix.

### 🔹 Program 8: Sorting Algorithms with Analysis
Generates random integers and performs:
- Bubble Sort  
- Selection Sort  
- Insertion Sort  
- Merge Sort  

Displays:
- Sorted output  
- Number of comparisons  
- Number of swaps

## ▶ How to Compile and Run

### Using GCC 
```bash
gcc prog_<q>.c -o prog_<q>
./prog_<q>
```

### Using Windows PowerShell (MinGW)
```powershell
gcc prog_<q>.c -o prog_<q>.exe
.\prog_<q>.exe
```

where `<q>` corresponds to the question number.
